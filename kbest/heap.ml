  (* Heaps are encoded as complete binary trees, i.e., binary trees
     which are full expect, may be, on the bottom level. 
     These trees also enjoy the heap property, namely the value of any node 
     is greater or equal than those of its left and right subtrees.

     The representation invariant is the following: the number of nodes in
     the left subtree is equal to the number of nodes in the right
     subtree, or exceeds it by exactly once. In the first case, we use
     the constructor [Same] and in the second the constructor [Diff].
     Then it can be proved that [2^(h-1) <= n <= 2^h] when [n] is the
     number of elements and [h] the height of the tree. *)
