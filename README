==== Getting started with mcfgcky2 ====

Prerequisites: OCaml, Mathematica.

(1) Download and unzip Mathieu Guillaumin's MG-to-MCFG translator:
      http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/stabler/guillaumin.tgz
    You should unzip this file in the same directory that contains your 
    SVN working copy, such that guillaumin and mcfgcky2 are sister 
    directories.

(2) Apply hmgtransform-fixity.patch to Guillaumin's code. From the root 
    of the SVN working copy, the following command works for us:
      patch ../guillaumin/hmg2mcfg/hmgtransform.ml hmgtransform-fixity.patch
    (If you get errors about a file name with a '..' component, try copying 
    the patch file into the guillaumin directory and patching from there.)

(3) In the guillaumin/hmc2mcfg directory, run 'make' and 'make clean' to 
    compile the newly-patched Guillaumin translator.

(4) In the mcfgcky2 directory, run 'make' to compile the parser.

You should now be able to do some simple things like:
  - Parse and display derivation trees to stdout:
      ./mcfg_nt grammars/wmcfg/strauss.wmcfg -trees "Jon hit the dog with the stick"
  - Generate an intersection grammar from an existing grammar and a prefix:
      ./mcfg_nt grammars/wmcfg/strauss.wmcfg -intersect -p "Jon hit"
