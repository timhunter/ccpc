I made a command-line tool today that reads a .wmcfg file directly.
Here are two examples:

   $ /home/cs872/mcfgcky2_repos/Generate -top /home/cs872/mcfgcky2_repos/grammars/wmcfg/strauss.wmcfg -infix "hit Jon"|head
   5.2734375e-2 [[the dog] [hit Jon]]
   5.2734375e-2 [[the stick] [hit Jon]]
   ...

   $ /home/cs872/mcfgcky2_repos/Generate -top /home/cs872/mcfgcky2_repos/grammars/wmcfg/strauss.wmcfg -exact "the dog hit the dog with the stick with Jon with Jon with Jon with Jon with Jon"
   3.978129825554788e-9 [[the dog] [hit [the [[[[[dog [with [the [stick [with Jon]]]]] [with Jon]] [with Jon]] [with Jon]] [with Jon]]]]]
   3.978129825554788e-9 [[the dog] [hit [the [[[[[[dog [with [the stick]]] [with Jon]] [with Jon]] [with Jon]] [with Jon]] [with Jon]]]]]
   ...

You can also say -prefix and -suffix.  The default is -infix "".

(If you pipe this output to less, you'd see that the program also prints
and overwrites 'countdown' probabilities, which you can filter out using
sed 's/.*\r//'
)

You can easily compile my Haskell code on garvin using my installation
of ghc 7.  Just add /home/cs872/local/bin to your $PATH and do
   ghc -main-is Generate -O2 -rtsopts -threaded --make Generate.hs
