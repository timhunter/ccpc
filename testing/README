This is a test script written in python. It is configurable using an XML configuration file.  It can be used to run a batch of tests.

To run the test script, you need to have python installed on your machine.  This is done by default in Linux and Mac OS X.

This is the format of the XML configuration file.  The strings GRAMMAR and SENTENCE must appear as written (in all caps). [args] designates that there may be any number of arguments (including zero) in that space.  
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<configuration>
<parser>
   <path>path_to_parser</path>
   <configuration>[args] GRAMMAR [args] SENTENCE [args]</configuration>
   <pass>string_designating_a_pass</pass>
   <fail>string_designating_a_failure</fail>
</parser>
<testcases>
   <test>
      <grammar>path_to_grammar_1</grammar>
      <sentences>
         <sentence>"sentence 1 goes here"</sentence>
         <sentence>"sentence 2 goes here"</sentence>
      </sentences>
   </test>
   <test>
      <grammar>path_to_grammar_2</grammar>
      <sentences>
         <sentence>"sentence 1 goes here"</sentence>
         <sentence>"sentence 2 goes here"</sentence>
      </sentences>
   </test>
</testcases>
</configuration>

To run the test script:
   ./runtests.py XMLCONFIGFILE
NOTE: If python is not in your path or is in your path at a different location, you may have to run:
   python runtests.py XMLCONFIGFILE
