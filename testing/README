This is a test script written in python. It is configurable using an XML configuration file.

It can be used in two ways:
   1 - To run a batch of tests
   2 - To run a grammar modifier (some executable that takes a grammer and outputs a grammar) and then run a batch of tests on both the modified and unmodified grammars.  As an example, this is useful to test the epsilon removal executable.

To run the test script, you need to have python installed on your machine.  This is done by default in Linux and Mac OS X.

This is the format of the XML configuration file.  The strings GRAMMAR, SENTENCE, and OUT must appear as written (in all caps). [args] designates that there may be any number of arguments (including zero) in that space.  To run without running a grammar modifier, just remove the grammar modifier section from the XML file.

      <sentences>

         <sentence>"sentence 2 goes here"</sentence>
      </sentences>
   </test>
</testcases>
</configuration>

To run the test script:
   ./runtests.py XMLCONFIGFILE
NOTE: If python is not in your path or is in your path at a different location, you may have to run:
   python runtests.py XMLCONFIGFILE
