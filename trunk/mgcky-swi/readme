mgcky - cky-like parser for "minimalist grammars"
version 1.0, 30 Aug 2002

The top file for loading files and demos is setup.pl.

After loading a grammar, showLexicon/0 shows the lexical items,
numbered as they are in the derivations delivered by the parser.

setup.pl is now configured so that if you load it
in a working SWI-prolog environment,
it should load a parser and grammar.
setup.pl has various test and top-level predicates.
For example, after loading grammar gh5.pl, you can execute
gh1(x) to run an example, and then type h at the prompt to
select from the tree display options.

The display utilities use tcl/tk and dot, which are freely
available at:

NOTE TO HACKERS: If you are going to trace the execution of this
code, you should first comment out the portray clauses that appear
at the ends of the parser files (mgpx.pl, mghapx.pl -- whichever 
you are using)
