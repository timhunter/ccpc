(* Types for representing ``derivation lists''. An element of a derivation list is either a marker 
   of a particular rule, or an encoding of a leaf of the derivation tree.
   In simple cases, where the result of Hale and Stabler 2005 is applicable, we don't need any rule 
   markers, and derivation lists are just lists of leaves. In other cases though, eg. adjunction, 
   Stabler's prolog code requires markers like '>>' and '<<' to be interspersed with these leaves 
   to disambiguate.
   Since Stabler's prolog code represents a leaf of a derivation tree with an int, the eventual 
   derivation list that we compute is of type int dlist. But we allow other types for leaf elements 
   for intermediate representations in the course of computing that final list.
   Intuitively: a "widget dlist" is a list of widgets interspersed with some rule markers. *)
